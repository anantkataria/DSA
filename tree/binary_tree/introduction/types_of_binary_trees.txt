Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree)
- Every node has 0 or 2 children
- All internal node has 2 children

Complete Binary Tree
- All levels are completely filled except last level
- last level has all keys as left as possible

Perfect Binary Tree
- all internal nodes have two children
- all leaf nodes are at the same level

Balanced Binary Tree
- overall height of the tree has to be log(n)
- example : AVL tree maintains logn height by making sure that the difference between heights of the left and right subtrees is at most 1
- example : Red-Black tree maintain this height by making sure that the number of black nodes on every path from node to leaf is same and there are no adjacent red nodes.

Degenerate (Pathological) Tree
- every internal node has one child

Skewed Binary Tree
- left dominated or right dominated degenerate tree.
