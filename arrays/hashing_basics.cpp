//learnings about hashing

//hashing is an improvement over direct access table

//hash function - converts given key to a small practical integer value
// this integer value is used as an index in hash table

//collision handling - situation where newly inserted key maps to an already occupied slot in hash table is called collision.
//1) Chaining
//2) Open Addressing

//index mapping is a trivial hashing
